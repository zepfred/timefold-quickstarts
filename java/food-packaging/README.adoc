== Prerequisites

. Install Java and Maven, for example with https://sdkman.io[Sdkman]:
+
----
$ sdk install java
$ sdk install maven
----

[[run]]
== Run the application

. Git clone the timefold-quickstarts repo and navigate to this directory:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts.git
...
$ cd timefold-quickstarts/java/food-packaging
----

. Start the application with Maven:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn quarkus:dev
----

. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

. Click on the *Solve* button.

Then try _live coding_:

. Make some changes in the source code.
. Refresh your browser (F5).

Notice that those changes are immediately in effect.

[[enterprise]]
== Run the application with Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition

For high-scalability use cases, switch to https://docs.timefold.ai/timefold-solver/latest/enterprise-edition/enterprise-edition[Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition],
our commercial offering.
https://timefold.ai/contact[Contact Timefold] to obtain the credentials required to access our private Enterprise Maven repository.

. Create `.m2/settings.xml` in your home directory with the following content:
+
--
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<settings>
  ...
  <servers>
    <server>
      <!-- Replace "my_username" and "my_password" with credentials obtained from a Timefold representative. -->
      <id>timefold-solver-enterprise</id>
      <username>my_username</username>
      <password>my_password</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
  ...
</settings>

. Start the application with Maven:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean quarkus:dev -Denterprise
----

. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

. Click on the *Solve* button.

Then try _live coding_:

. Make some changes in the source code.
. Refresh your browser (F5).

Notice that those changes are immediately in effect.

[[package]]
== Run the packaged application

When you're done iterating in `quarkus:dev` mode,
package the application to run as a conventional jar file.

. Compile it with Maven:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package
----

. Run it:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ java -jar ./target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To run it on port 8081 instead, add `-Dquarkus.http.port=8081`.

. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

. Click on the *Solve* button.

[[container]]
== Run the application in a container

. Build a container image:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package -Dcontainer
----
The container image name
. Run a container:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm $USER/food-packaging:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

[[native]]
== Run it native

To increase startup performance for serverless deployments,
build the application as a native executable:

. https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#configuring-graalvm[Install GraalVM and gu install the native-image tool]

. Compile it natively. This takes a few minutes:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package -Dnative -DskipTests
----

. Run the native executable:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ ./target/*-runner
----

. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

. Click on the *Solve* button.
